EASY: After the user completes adding new time entries, I want the Add New Time Entry window to automatically close itself such that it's snappier. The user finishes entering the time entry and then they instantly see the official feedback with the new time entry in their chosen option of list or card view. 

EASY: I want to make it so that on the dashboard in the card view the user cannot edit the total amount of time in the overall card container. This doesn't really make sense because imagine if the user has two tasks within the overall card, one for 3.5 hours and one for one hour, the total time would be 4.5 hours, which is reflected on the top. However, this should not be changeable by the user. 

MEDIUM: I want to make the calendar page as seen here more like the mock. Specifically, we need to make it so that the calendar doesn't fluctuate too much in vertical height. Maybe we can hide some of the extra billing entries. Let's say if the user had seven entries in one day, maybe we could display four and then have something below that says like plus three more. We need to make it also so that the user is able to select billing entries and also export them directly from the calendar view. The export button should show up when the user has selected some entries on the calendar view. Make sure that this works on both the normal view and mobile view. 
Give Claude chat both mocks and ask it to improve the prompt. 

EASY: I want to remove the ready status for the field that has draft, ready, and exported. I think it'll actually be better if it's just draft and exported with no option to manually change it. I think this should automatically change after the user actually exports an entry from draft to exported. This will simplify the design. 

MEDIUM: I want to fix the card view, list view icon in both the standard view and the smaller screen mode. 
EASY: I want to make it so that the list view is also as mobile compatible as the card view. Currently the right side of the list view is being cut off when the user chooses to use the smaller screen size.
